# finding_common_pollutants_using_GCN_model
This project analyzes air pollution levels using a temporal dataset consisting of city-wise pollutant values and their corresponding Air Quality Index (AQI) values. The primary objective is to identify the pollutant that has exceeded the unhealthy threshold most frequentlyâ€”both across all cities combined and for individual cities.
